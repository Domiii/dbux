## Examples

### Example1: sample program {#example1}

This example demonstrates the ACG of a sample program:

<Img screen src="dbux-all-async1.png" />

The ACG (right) renders the program <Term term="CGRs" /> and the [asynchronous event edges](#ae) that connect them. The vertical axis is time (pointing downwards) and the horizontal dimension is a new experimental measure of "virtual threads" or "degree of concurrency".

* Code: The red solid border around the `done()` call expression indicates that it is [selected](./05-select-trace.mdx).
* In the ACG, the `await Promise.all(...)` node is also selected (due to [follow mode](./08-call-graph.mdx#follow)), indicated by a yellow solid border.
  * &rarr; This means that `done()` is in the CGR of that corresponding asynchronous continuation (or "virtual/resume context"). 
  * &rarr; This also means that `done()`'s CGR executed after the awaited promise settled.
* The dashed (red) border around the nodes on the left (`f1`, `sleep1s`, `f2`) indicate that the selected node "[synchronizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science))" against them.
  * &rarr; Those CGRs are part of a promise that scheduled earlier but had to finish before this root could start executing.
* Other observations:
  * `f2` will always follow `f1`, `g2` will always follow `g1` and `h2` follows `h1`.
  * The ACG also clearly shows that  `f`, `g` and `h` are executing concurrently.
  * &rarr; If someone wrote code requiring `h` to always finish after `f`, or `g` after `h`, there might be a [race condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) because there is no such order assured in the code. That is why the ACG renders the three functions on separate "virtual threads" (vertical columns), illustrating that concurrency.


### Example2: todomvc {#example2}

This example demonstrates the ACG of [todomvc (vanilla-es6)](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/vanilla-es6):

<!-- TODO: take todovmc pic again -->

<Img screen src="todomvc-sample-acg1.png" />

* In this example, `val` (aka [value mode](./08-call-graph.mdx#value)) is enabled.
  * This option renders the value of the first execution of the currently selected trace in each <Term term="CGR" />.
  * In the ACG, we can see the value of `selector` for each <Term term="CGR" />, allowing us to see where/when the corresponding event (of this particular event handler) for each selector were handled.
  * We can click into each individual node to get us to the relevant execution of that event handler.
* NOTE: Event handler invocations of the same event are rendered in the same column.

## What is the Asynchronous Call Graph (ACG)?

The Asynchronous Call Graph (ACG) is the [call graph](./08-call-graph.mdx) in `Async` mode. You can see the ACG by opening the [call graph](./08-call-graph.mdx) and switching to `Async` mode (by clicking the `Sync` button in the [toolbar](./08-call-graph.mdx#toolbar)). The two call graph modes share many features, including the toolbar buttons, coloring and more, as explained [here](./08-call-graph.mdx#toolbar).

`Sync` mode allows inspecting children and children of children of file and function executions. However, it simply puts <Term term="call graph roots" /> on a single linear vertical timeline. The ACG, on the other hand, uncovers the hidden connections between those roots on multiple vertical timelines and connections rendered between them.
In other words, `Sync` mode is great for inspecting control flow **within** individual <Term term="call graph roots" />, while `Async` mode is great for inspecting control flow **between** them.
In many debugging scenarios, you probably want to toggle between the two modes, as you investigate the control flow of an application.

:::


## Why?

[Asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous) and its relatives, [parallel programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_programming) and [concurrent computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing), lead to much more complex execution pattern than their non-asynchronous, non-parallel, non-concurrent counterparts. In fact, asynchronous semantics are one of the most daunting aspects of JavaScript that software developers have to deal with on a day-to-day basis, making it <span className="cursor-help highlight-on-hover" title="This is a generic statement, so phrased for dramatic effect, not for accuracy.">feared by many, underestimated by the rest<sup>*</sup></span>.

With the ACG we hope to make asynchronous JavaScript a lot easier to understand and digest. It presents a clear picture of an application's asynchronous control flow, and makes many types of <Term term="race conditions" /> visually obvious. It can also help uncover lacking error propagation and a lot more. For example, if your application's ACG has many individual columns, but a low level of actual concurrency (things don't actually happen concurrently), it might indicate that you (i) forgot to `await` or otherwise chain or nest your promises, or maybe (ii) are suffering from legacy code involving asynchronous callbacks and potential callback hell, that would benefit from re-writing using modern explicit asynchronous semantics.
<!-- TODO: examples for visible race conditions -->


## JavaScript Execution Semantics

:::note
This section gets rather technical, as it goes deeper into JavaScript Execution Semantics, where we introduce relevant terminology as it pertains to JavaScript's asynchronous semantics and how it affects the ACG.
:::

Modern JavaScript engines are driven by a single-threaded event loop dispatching events from multiple queues<sup>[1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop)</sup> <sup>[2](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/)</sup>. These queued events include all user-requested JavaScript events, such as the program's entry point, event handler callbacks and asynchronous continuations<!--  (i.e. continuations of function stacks interrupted by root-level `await` or `yield`) -->.

JavaScript is non-preemptive and single-threaded, thereby guaranteeing that once dequeued, a script keeps executing until the call stack has no more user code on it, or until it interrupts itself with a root-level `await` or `yield`, before another event is dequeued.

The ACG captures most asynchronous semantics of [ES2022](https://www.google.com/search?q=ES2022), sans [dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#dynamic_imports). Note that in order to be accurate, it requires Promises to adhere to the [A+ specification](https://promisesaplus.com/), as modern browsers, Node and other JS engines do.
<!-- specifically, we assume that `thenCbs` must be executed asynchronously. -->


### Call Graph Roots (CGR) {#cgr}

Call Graph Roots (CGRs) are the ***nodes*** of the Asynchronous Call Graph (ACG).

A CGR represents the invocation of a piece of code from outside our visible (recorded) runtime by the JavaScript engine. Most of the time that will be the first execution of a file or function on a stack that is empty or only contains frames that have not been recorded.
<!-- [^3] -->

Examples of CGRs include:

* The application's entry point.
* A promise handler callback.
* Continuation of an async function, after an `await` expression. (NOTE: This is a type of CGR where the stack is not empty.)
* Asynchronous executions of a JavaScript file, e.g. when `require`d or `import`ed by `node` or the webpack (or other) bundling system. (NOTE: Not all files are executed asynchronously.)
* Browser executing a &lt;script> tag.
* Execution of a callback supplied to `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setIntermediate`, `Process.nextTick`, `Promise.then` etc. These callbacks are scheduled and, at a later point in time, executed by the underlying JS runtime environment.
* Event handler callbacks (e.g. DOM's [addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener), Node's [fs.watchFile](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fswatchfilefilename-options-listener) etc.).

<!--
TODO: virtual contexts + async explanations. 
  also: SyncCG children exclude [asynchronous continuations](#asynchronous-continuation)
  -> link paper
-->

<!-- A CGR is defined as "belonging to", or "owned by" a promise `p`, if the CGR is directly scheduled via `p`. That includes `p`'s `thenCbs`, async function resume roots (the owner `p` is its `callerPromise`) and promisified asynchronous callbacks. Note that not all promises <!-- (e.g. `Promise.resolve()`) --> have CGRs. -->

:::note
The [`synchronous` call graph](../dbux-features/08-call-graph.mdx) lists all CGRs on a linear timeline and allows inspecting individual children and subtrees of each root. The ACG, on the other hand, only shows CGRs (and none of their children), but further visualizes [their relationships](#chain-fork).
:::

### Asynchronous Events (AE) {#ae}

<!-- In order to better understand CGRs and the relationships between them, we define: -->

Asynchronous events (AEs) are the ***edges*** of the ACG, connecting CGRs. Any AE `e` has at the following properties:

* `scheduler` - the event (<Term term="trace" />) that created it and its [CGR](#cgr) `fromRoot`, and
* `toRoot` - the [CGR](#cgr) that executes upon its completion.

We define three types of asynchronous events in JavaScript:

* `AWAIT` <!-- \textemdash{} -->- Scheduled by an `await` expression. `toRoot(e)` is the root of the continuation's virtual context or "resume context/root".
* `THEN` <!-- \textemdash{} -->- Scheduled by `q = p.THEN(f[, g])` for some promise `p`. For brevity, we use `THEN` to represent `then`, `catch` and `finally`. `toRoot(e)` is that of `e`'s fulfillment or rejection handler, which we also call `thenCb`.
* `CB` <!-- \textemdash{} -->- Asynchronous callbacks scheduled by a call to an uninstrumented function which takes at least one argument `f` of type `function`.

The following three implementations of a `send` file function illustrate the three AE types. In all three cases, the resulting Asynchronous Call Graph (ACG) feature three nodes, connected by two edges:

<div className="flex flex-row flex-wrap">
  <CodeBlock className="border-purple" lang="js" src="async-send-file-await.js" />
  <HSpace />
  <CodeBlock className="border-purple" lang="js" src="async-send-file-promise.js" />
  <HSpace />
  <CodeBlock className="border-purple" lang="js" src="async-send-file-cb.js" />
</div>

Note that asynchronous events can either be one-shot (one-to-one: one `toRoot` per `scheduler`) or repeating (one-to-many: one `scheduler` can have 0 or more `toRoot`s). `THEN` and `AWAIT` type of events are always one-shot, while asynchronous callbacks can be executed multiple times, e.g. in case of `setInterval`, `addEventListener` etc.


### Execution Patterns: CHAINs vs. FORKs {#chain-fork}

In order to capture and visualize degree of concurrency of JavaScript applications, the ACG further classifies <Term term="AEs" /> (i.e. the edges of the <Term term="ACG" />) into CHAINs and FORKs.
Making that distinction is the same as asking: are the events of the `toRoot` a logical continuation of the events of the `fromRoot` (CHAIN)? Or are they the start of something new (FORK)?

NOTE: CHAINs between AWAIT and THEN event roots propagate errors, while CBs have no automatic error propagation mechanism.

Below are several illustrations of asynchronous programs and their expected conceptual ACG with CHAINs (blue) and FORKs (purple):

<div className="flex flex-row w-full">
  <div className="flex-col w-half">
    <Img concept src="chain_fork_1.png" />
    <Img concept src="chain_fork_3.png" />
  </div>
  <div className="flex-col w-half">
    <Img concept src="chain_fork_2.png" />
  </div>
</div>


#### The "first CHAIN Problem"

This example illustrates one of the difficulties involved in trying to determine CHAIN vs. FORK for the first `await` in an async function (similar logic applies to the first `then` in a promise chain):

<div className="border-purple mb-2">
<div className="mb-05">
  <CodeBlock lang="js">{`
async function f() {
  FA
  await 0;  // E1
  FB
  await 0;  // E2
  FC
}
  `}</CodeBlock>
</div>

<div className="grid-2-col">
  <CodeBlock lang="js">{`
// ex1: E1 is FORK
A; f(); B;
  `}</CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock lang="js">{`
// ex2: E1 is CHAIN
A; await f(); B;
  `}</CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock lang="js">{`
// ex3: E1 is FORK
await g();
function g() { f(); }
  `}</CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock lang="js">{`
// ex4: E1 is CHAIN
let p; h(); await p;
function h() { p = f(); }
  `}</CodeBlock>
</div>

</div>

In the four examples above, `f` has two AEs `E1` and `E2`. `E2` is always a CHAIN, but `E1` might be CHAIN or FORK, depending on the caller. Assume that the example codes ex1-ex4 are all at root-level.

<!-- CB-type events often do not provide enough information to distinguish between FORK and CHAIN, which is why we classify them as FORK, unless they are promisified or match a set of CALLBACK\_CHAIN\_HEURISTICS. In those cases, they are classified as CHAIN. -->


### Promise Creation and Promise Nesting {#promise-nesting}

Certain types of promises can be nested dynamically. Nested promises are always [chained](#chain-fork).

<!-- This allows for the nested promise to TODO(more basic and background). -->

In JavaScript, promises can be created in five ways, some allow promise nesting:

1. The Promise constructor takes an executor function which in turn is provided two parameters: the `resolve` and `reject` functions which are to be called to settle the promise. The executor function is called synchronously from the constructor. The Promise constructor is commonly used to wrap asynchronous callbacks into promises. This process is commonly referred to as "promisification".
<!-- new Promise(
  r => r(console.log(1), sleep(100).then(() => console.log(2)))
).then(() => console.log(3)) // 1 -> 3 -> 2 -->
2. `Promise.resolve(x)` and `Promise.reject(x)` are equivalent to using the (i) Promise constructor and synchronously calling `resolve` or `reject` respectively. `Promise.all` and `Promise.race` work similar to `resolve` but allow nesting multiple promises. `Promise.all` fulfills once all nested promises fulfill and rejects once any promise rejects. `Promise.race` fulfills once any nested promise fulfills and rejects if any promise rejects before any other fulfills.
3. When an async function is called, the runtime environment creates a new promise. Its call expression value is set to that promise. Async functions execute synchronously until the first `await` is encountered. This means that if an async function concluded without explicitly invoking an `await` expression or any of the three other types of events, it does not trigger an asynchronous event. Await expressions can nest promises. Furthermore, promises can be nested by returning them from an async function.
4. Promise chaining (`then`, `catch`, `finally`) allows for promise nesting by returning a promise from their respective fulfillment and rejection handler callbacks.
5. [Dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import\#Dynamic_Imports) and other native functions create and return promises.
   * NOTE: The first dynamic import of a file can be seen as nesting top-level `awaits` of the imported files, but the <Term term="ACG" /> does not yet capture asynchronous events related to dynamic imports.

Somewhat counter-intuitively, (1), (2) and (3) do *not* cause an asynchronous event on their own.
However, all of them can nest promises. Most of these nesting relationships are captured by Dbux's [asynchronous call graph](../dbux-features/08-call-graph.mdx#async).

#### Example

<div className="flex flex-row flex-center">
  <CodeBlock className="border-screen" lang="js" src="async-sleep.js" />
  <div className="font-size-3">
    &rarr;
  </div>
  <div>
    <Img screen src="sample-async-sleep.png" />
  </div>
</div>

Above example implements `sleep` using `setTimeout`. The Promise constructor itself ***does not*** trigger an [asynchronous event](#ae) but `setTimeout` does. We thus only see one ACG node per call to `sleep`.

<!-- [^3]: In terms of the [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/) terminology, this is equivalent to executing a piece of code when the stack "contains only platform code". -->


### More on Asynchronous Execution Semantics

While there is a lot more to be said, for now, we plan to link relevant papers once they are published. Stay tuned (if you feel like it).
